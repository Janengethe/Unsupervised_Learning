## Unsupervised Learning
* Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which algorithms learn to identify patterns, structures, or relationships within unlabelled data.
* The primary purpose of unsupervised learning is to uncover hidden structures, groupings, or associations in the data that might not be apparent to human intuition or observation.
